#  Tintumol Ai  üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Valaxia


### Team Members
- Member 1: Vipin Das Velappan - College of Engineering Adoor
- Member 2: Ashwin Wilson - College of Engineering Adoor

### Project Description
Meet Tintumol, the cutest AI avatar who listens, thinks, and talks back‚Ä¶ in Malayalam! Powered by Google Gemini and a dash of Pygame magic, she‚Äôll answer your questions, roast you politely, and keep you entertained with her animated charm.

Think Siri, but with more attitude, a Malayalam accent, and better dance moves.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world is facing an alarming shortage of talking cartoon friends who can chat in Malayalam while wiggling on your screen. Millions are forced to rely on boring, static AI assistants that don‚Äôt even blink. This tragedy has led to record levels of loneliness, awkward Google searches, and burnt omelettes due to lack of conversational guidance.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Tintumol‚Ñ¢‚Äîthe world‚Äôs first (probably) Malayalam-speaking, perpetually dancing AI friend who lives in your computer window. Equipped with advanced chit-chat skills powered by Google Gemini and the unstoppable energy of an animated GIF, Tintumol will listen to your voice, think really hard (or pretend to), and respond in smooth Malayalam tones.

No more boring conversations with faceless bots‚ÄîTintumol blinks, bops, and beams while telling you stuff you didn‚Äôt ask for but will absolutely treasure. It‚Äôs not just AI‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs emotional AI.
